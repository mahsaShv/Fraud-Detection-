# Fraud-Detection
Rahnema College Challenge

## Objective ##

This code is designed to detect potential fraudulent behavior among accounts that might be rating themselves to skew their public perception. By analyzing patterns and relationships within the dataset, this model aims to highlight such suspicious accounts, providing a mechanism to safeguard the integrity of ratings on platforms.

## Context ##

Some accounts on online platforms can artificially boost their reputation by creating tasks and giving positive rates to themselves. These artificially inflated ratings can mislead genuine users, making this kind of fraud particularly harmful for the credibility and reliability of rating-based systems.
